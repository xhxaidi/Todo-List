# To-Do List Website

## Description
This is a simple, dynamic, and interactive To-Do List website built using **vanilla JavaScript**. It demonstrates core JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage. The project enables users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:**
  - Dynamically add tasks to the To-Do list.
  - The input field takes the task's name, and the task is rendered in the list.
- **Update Tasks:**
  - Edit an existing task's name directly on the list.
- **Delete Tasks:**
  - Remove a task from the list with the delete option.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed (Cross Option):**
  - Click on a task to mark it as completed. A strikethrough style is applied to indicate completion.
- **Local Storage Integration:**
  - Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads.
  - Tasks are automatically loaded from local storage when the page is opened.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling the To-Do list.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and functionality, including:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Local storage

3. **Deleting a Task:**
